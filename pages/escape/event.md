The [Fall Challenge 2021](https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2021) starting on October 28 will be a Coding Escape mission.

## Coding Escape

Learn about the Coding Escape game format [here](pages/escape/general.md). For more information about the corporate team-building offer, please [fill this form](https://codingame.typeform.com/to/tDphTbVB#from=fc2021).

## The event

1. How much does it cost?
	
	Participating in this community event is free.

2. Do I need a CodinGame account to participate?

	Yes, you need to create a CodinGame account before being able to register for the challenge. We strongly suggest playing the [Coding Escape tutorial](https://escape.codingame.com/games/2) and one of the two publicly available missions before participating.

3. When does the event start and end?

	The event start time is on [October 28th at 4pm UTC](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/event?lid=100%2C2988507%2C2988507&h=100&sts=27256320&sln=16-18&a=show&euid=ad70cf26-45d2-e734-c155-58dc0b1656df). It starts at the same time for all players in the world, whatever the time zone.

	However, the mission won't be available to play right away. We'll wait for approximately 15 minutes for most teams to be ready before officially opening the mission for everyone.

	The mission itself should take between 30 minutes and 4 hours depending on the teams. The event however is opened for 7 days.

4. How do I join a team?

	By registering to the event, you automatically join an empty team.

	You can either send your team link to your friends for them to join your team.

	Or you can use the team link of a friend to automatically join their team (you can't leave a team you're a leader of, you must first kick your teammates out).

## The competition

1. How is the ranking working?

	To prevent cheating, the default leaderboard will rank teams according to the official start time of the event. It will also be possible to sort the teams by the time they took to solve the mission whenever they started.

2. Are there any prize to win?

	We'll award CodinGame T-Shirts to each player of the top 5 teams.

3. Are there any achievements to unlock or coding points to get?

	The _Finish in the top X, in any contest_ and _Finish in the top X in a language ranking, in any contest_ achievements can't be unlocked during this event. Also, this challenge won't count for the [contest leaderboard](https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/contests/global).
