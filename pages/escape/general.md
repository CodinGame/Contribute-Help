## What's Coding Escape

Coding Escape is a 100% online game experience, based on real-life escape rooms. It's a fun mix of logic, riddles and coding puzzles.

Players work together, crack codes, solve mystery, and code their way through a fun narrative.

## Coding Escape for corporate team building

There is a limited number of public missions. The rest of the missions are part of a bundle reserved for a corporate team-building offer.

## Solving a mission

Each Coding Escape mission is a race against the clock.

Your team needs to solve each puzzle, overcome each obstacle, in order to succeed (whether that means fixing a 19th century time machine or finding a flux capacitor in a deserted arcade room). 
 
Start by hunting for clues, looking around, and clicking on anything that looks useful. You’ll soon see that you can interact with the objects you uncover.

Remember to communicate with your teammates.

Depending on your team and the mission, completing a mission should take from 30 minutes to 3 hours.

## Teams

Coding Escape is a game for coders *and* non-coders too.

Some of the puzzles require small code snippets to be solved. However, there’s plenty for non-coders to figure out. They can use the manual mode to solve puzzles.

At least one coder is required per team, which can contain from 2 to 6 players.

For now, Coding Escape supports 12 programming languages:

- C
- C++
