tl, dr:

```
- Be respectful and considerate
- Be humble and supportive of each other
```

In details:

1. **Respect the diversity of fellow membersâ€™ backgrounds, perspectives, education, and experiences.**

	We all come from different places, we all have a different story. Please pay attention to how you communicate with other members in the community.

2. **No abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind is tolerated.**

	Don't spam nor flood the chat with non-sense, jokes or private discussions. While CodinGame and its community are free to access, it doesn't give you rights to make it your playground. It's a shared space.

3. **Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.**

	It's normal to disagree or to be frustrated. But don't annoy other members, mods or staff with your humor of poor taste and your mood swings.

4. **Cheating is discouraged.**

	Don't solve a puzzle/game in a way that falls outside the puzzle/game itself (notably but not limited to: exploiting CodinGame's test framework, website and servers).

Failing to follow these community guidelines as described above carries consequences.
For minor infractions, you may be kicked from the public discussion places of CodinGame and issued a final warning. Upon repeated offences, or if the moderation team believes you are not acting in good faith, you may be banned permanently from CodinGame.

If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, or if you witness it, please let Thibaud from CodinGame (thibaud@codingame.com) know, or report the user directly on their profile.
