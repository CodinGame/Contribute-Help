## What is a CodingHub?

A CodingHub is an event where developers meet, code and converse. Most of the times, they happen during a coding contest, so players can't discuss the game and share strategies.

CodingHubs are organized by volunteers, with the assistance of CodinGame. Want to host one? [See below ⬇️](pages/community/hub.md#host)

## <a name="host"></a>How to host a CodingHub?

Just fill [this form](https://codingame.typeform.com/to/ihoVPP). Thibaud will contact you and add your CodingHub to the list above.

### Guidelines

1. Pick a date and time for your CodingHub
_They are usually held in the evening after work and last 2 to 3 hours._

2. Find the venue: a room at your company/university*, coworking space, bar/cafe...
_The place must be equipped with sufficient power plugs and network connections (and chairs)_

3. Promote your CodingHub using a Facebook or Meetup event.
_Invite your friends and colleagues, or other CodinGamers_

4. Arrange if possible for small catering
_What you can do is to make arrangements with participants and share the price_

*Don't forget to ask for the authorization to host the hub and to invite external people.

### Why using Meetup or Facebook?

It allows you to manage registrations.

It also helps other developers to find out about your event.

Finally, it allows us to assess how many goodies to send.
_Pack of goodies will be sent to CodingHubs with at least 5 people registered to the hub 10 days before the start of the contest._
