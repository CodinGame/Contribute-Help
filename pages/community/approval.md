## Aproval process

A contribution needs 3 votes from approvers for approval/rejection to get approved/rejected.

Any contribution that doesn't respect one or more guidelines from the [contribution guidelines](/pages/community/guidelines.md) can be rejected.

Once approved, a contribution gets published as a puzzle/game on the platform. The contribution is still accessible in the list of accepted contributions.
Once rejected, a contribution is sent back to the author's list of contributions as rejected. The creator can improve the contribution and resubmit it for another community approval.

## Approval Rights
  
There are two different approval rights:

- **Approver right**: approvers can approve or reject contributions. They also can edit contributions under review (not yet approved/rejected).
- **Editor right**: editors have approver rights. Editors can also edit approved contributions.

- Any player who has played more than **50** clashes has approver rights.
- Any player who has played more than **300** clashes has editor rights.

For all other contribution types:

- Any player whose level is greater or equals to **20** has approver rights.
- Any player whose level is greater or equals to **29** has editor rights.

## Automatic Removal of low quality puzzles

### Votes and ratings

Any member of the community can vote (upvote/downvote) a contribution or a comment. Votes are only informative.

Any member of the community can rate a puzzle from 1 to 5 stars.

Any member of the community can rate a Clash of Code puzzle from 1 to 5 stars on 4 different criteria:
- quality of the statement
- difficulty
- fun
- test cases quality

### Contribution Bot

Once a puzzle/game/CoC puzzle has received enough ratings, a bot will regularly check its ratings against quality thresholds and possibly remove it from the pool of published puzzles/games/CoC puzzles.

A CoC puzzle having a bad rating in any of the 4 rating criteria will be removed.

For Clash of Code, the average rating is computed by mode; this means that modes of the CoC will be progressively removed until there is none, and the CoC contribution is finally rejected.

Any puzzle/game having a bad global rating will be removed.
